1. Physical Memory Map
Components of Physical Memory:

    BIOS Reserved Area: This is the memory area reserved for the BIOS firmware. It typically occupies the lower portion of the physical memory.

    Kernel Memory: This is the memory reserved for the kernel and its data structures. It should be contiguous and mapped in the higher address ranges of physical memory.

    User Memory: This is the memory space available for user applications. It usually starts above the kernel memory and extends up to the maximum addressable physical memory.

Steps to Define the Physical Memory Layout:

    Identify Memory Regions:
        Determine the total size of physical memory available on your system.
        Understand the memory regions that are reserved for the BIOS and other system-specific uses.

    Allocate Space for the Kernel:
        Reserve a contiguous block of memory for the kernel and its data structures.
        Ensure this area is protected from user access.

    Allocate Space for User Applications:
        Define the region where user applications will be loaded.
        Ensure it starts immediately above the kernel and extends to the maximum physical memory address.

    Define Memory for System Devices:
        Identify any memory regions required for system devices (like graphics cards, network adapters, etc.).

    Map Out Specific Addresses:
        Specify any fixed addresses required by hardware or specific kernel features (like the initial page tables, boot stack, etc.).

Example Physical Memory Layout (Simplified):

    BIOS Area: 0x00000000 - 0x000FFFFF (1MB)
    Kernel Area: 0x00100000 - 0x0FFFFFFF (255MB, assuming 256MB RAM)
    User Area: 0x10000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF (Up to 4GB, assuming 4GB RAM)

2. Virtual Memory Layout
Components of Virtual Memory:

    Kernel Space: This is the memory space where the kernel operates. It's typically a large contiguous range of virtual addresses.

    User Space: This is the memory space available for user applications. It's separated from the kernel space and has its own set of protections and mappings.

Steps to Define the Virtual Memory Layout:

    Define Kernel Virtual Address Space:
        Specify the range of virtual addresses reserved for the kernel. This is typically a large contiguous block of memory.

    Define User Virtual Address Space:
        Specify the range of virtual addresses allocated for user applications. This is separate from the kernel space and has its own set of page tables.

    Map Kernel Physical Memory to Virtual Addresses:
        Set up the page tables to map the kernel's physical memory to its corresponding virtual addresses.

    Set Up User Space Page Tables:
        Create page tables that map the user space virtual addresses to their corresponding physical addresses.

    Configure Memory Protection:
        Define the memory protection mechanisms (read-only, no-execute, etc.) for both kernel and user spaces.

Example Virtual Memory Layout (Simplified):

    Kernel Virtual Space: 0xFFFF800000000000 - 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (256TB, assuming 48-bit addressing)
    User Virtual Space: 0x0000000000000000 - 0x00007FFFFFFFFFFF (128TB, assuming 48-bit addressing)




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Define Requirements and Goals

Before diving into coding, define what you need from your memory management system. Consider the following aspects:

    Memory Layout: Decide how your kernel will organize memory (e.g., kernel space, user space).
    Memory Allocation: Decide on the strategies for allocating and freeing memory (e.g., buddy system, slab allocator).
    Virtual Memory: Determine if you will implement virtual memory and paging.

2. Understand Memory Architecture

Understand how memory works in your target architecture (x86-64 in your case):

    Physical Memory: Accessing RAM directly.
    Virtual Memory: Address translation, paging, and protection.
    Kernel vs. User Space: Differentiate between memory used by the kernel and that used by user processes.

3. Choose an Initial Approach

For simplicity, start with a basic approach and expand later:

    Bump Allocator: A simple method where memory is allocated sequentially.
    Buddy Allocator: Allocates memory in powers of two, efficient for splitting and coalescing.
    Slab Allocator: Allocates memory in predefined-size blocks.

4. Implement Basic Functions

Begin by implementing essential memory functions:

    Initialization: Set up your memory manager during kernel initialization.
    Allocation: Implement functions to allocate memory.
    Freeing: Implement functions to release allocated memory.

5. Manage Memory Mapping

Manage how memory is mapped:

    Page Tables: Implement basic page tables for mapping virtual to physical memory.
    Paging: Implement paging to allow for virtual memory.

6. Testing and Debugging

    Unit Tests: Write tests for each function you implement.
    Integration Tests: Test memory management alongside other kernel functions.
    Debugging: Implement debug messages to track memory usage and errors.
